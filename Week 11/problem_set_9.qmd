## Question 1

*Points: 10*

Table 1 below reports the results from two regression models. In Model 1 in Table 1 $Y$ is regressed on $X_1$ and, in Model 2, $Y$ is regressed on both $X_1$ and $X_2$. Why might $X_1$ be statistically significant at conventional levels in Model 1 but statistically insignificant in Model 2? Be as specific as possible.

**Answer**:
Firstly, this shift in significance suggests that the relationship between $X_1$ and $Y$ is primarily driven by $X_2$. The coefficient for $X_1$ decreases with the introduction of $X_2$ in the second model, indicating that the effects of $X_1$ on $Y$ are smaller when holding all values of $X_2$ constant. Simply put, $X_2$'s significance and larger coefficient gives it more explanatory value. Finally, these changes in $X_1$'s coefficient and significance level may also point to a potential correlation between $X_1$ and $X_2$.

## Question 2

*Points: 10*

Using the `censusAggregate` dataset (posted on ELMs), which is survey data aggregated to the state level (1972-2000), estimate a regression with `vote` as the dependent variable and the following independent variables: `nonSouth`, `edr`, and `pcthsg`. Report the results in a professionally formatted table and interpret the regression results.

Also, create a figure to display the predicted values (with confidence intervals) for the effect of `pcthsg` on the turnout rate. Lastly, is it meaningful to interpret the constant term on its own? Why, or why not?

::: callout-note
`vote` is the turnout rate in a state in a given year (i.e., the number of people who voted divided by the number eligible to vote).

`nonSouth` is a dummy variable equal to `0` for Southern states and a `1` for non-Southern states.

`pcthsg` is the percentage of the population in a state that graduated high school.

`edr` is a dummy variable equal to `1` for states that used election-day registration and a `0` for states without election-day registration.

**Answer**:
```{r}
#import data
CA_raw <- read_csv(
  here::here("/Users/crankadelia/Documents/GVPT_622/Week 11/censusAggregate-1.csv")) 

#design multivariate regression model
CA_multi <- lm(vote ~ nonSouth + edr + pcthsg, data = CA_raw)

#summarize results
summary(CA_multi)

#format summary table
modelsummary(CA_multi, 
             coef_rename = c(vote = "State turnout rate",
                             nonSouth = "Southern state",
                             pcthsg = "Graduated high school (Pop. %)",
                             edr = "Election-day registration"),
             statistic = c("t = {statistic}", "SE = {std.error}", "conf.int"))

#plot effect pcthsg on vote with CI
plot_predictions(CA_multi, condition = "pcthsg") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Percentage of state population that graduated high school",
       y = "State turnout rate",
       title = "Predicted values for the effect of HS graduation rate on state turnout rate")
```

*No, it is not meaningful to interpret the constant value of* `pcthsg` *on its own.* This is because the constant term indicates the point where the regression intercepts the Y-axis. In the terms of this model, the constant value represents the average state turnout rate for a state in which zero percent of the population graduate high school. This data offers no inferential value given that a U.S. state with no high school graduates does not exist. However, in the figure plotting the predicted values for the relationship between `pcthsg` and `vote`, the intercept begins somewhere in the low-40 values of the X-axis, which is far more realistic than a constant which begins at 0. 

## Question 3

*Points: 5*

Using the regression results from the previous question, evaluate the null hypothesis that the effects (i.e., regression coefficients) of `nonSouth` and `pcthsg` are jointly equal to zero. Can you reject the null hypothesis? Be sure to demonstrate how you reached a definitive conclusion.

**Answer**:
*Yes, we can* ***reject*** *the null hypothesis*. 

## Question 4

*Points: 15*

Using one of the other data sets available in the `poliscidata` package pick one dependent variable and two or more independent variables. Run a regression of the dependent variable on the independent variables. In your answer, describe why you picked the variables you did, produce a professionally formatted results table, and describe your statistical and substantive findings.
