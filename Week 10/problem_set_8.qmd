Please upload your completed assignment to the ELMs course site (under the assignments menu). Remember to include an annotated script file for all work with R and show your math for all other problems (if applicable, or necessary). Please also upload your completed assignment to the Github repository that you have shared with us. *We should be able to run your script with no errors.*

## Question 1

*Points: 5*

For the following regression equation, $\hat{Y} = 8.5 + 6x + \epsilon$, the standard error for $\beta_0$ is 2.5, the standard error for $\beta_1$ is 3.5, and the sample size is 2000. Find the t-statistic, 95% confidence interval, and p-value (using a two-tailed test) for $\beta_1$.

Is $\beta_1$ statistically significant at the 0.05-level with a two-tailed test? Why or why not?

## Question 2

*Points: 5*

Suppose you estimate an OLS regression and retrieve a $R^2$ value of 0.45. If the Total Sum of Squares (TSS) from that regression equals 4,700, what is the value for the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)?

## Question 3

*Points: 5*

Suppose you estimate a bivariate regression with a sample size of 102 and obtain a regression coefficient ($\beta_1$) of 5.0. What is the largest standard error that $\beta_1$ could have and still be statistically significant (i.e., reject the null hypothesis of no relationship) at the 0.05 level with a one-tailed test?

## Question 4

*Points: 5*

```{r}
gapminder_df <- wbstats::wb_data(c("NY.GDP.PCAP.CD", "SP.DYN.LE00.IN"),
                                 start_date = 2019, end_date = 2019) |> 
  dplyr::rename(gdp_per_cap = "NY.GDP.PCAP.CD", life_exp = "SP.DYN.LE00.IN")
```

Using the `gapminder_df` data set read in above, produce a scatterplot of the variables `gdp_per_cap` and `life_exp` (with `life_exp` as the dependent variable on the y-axis). Fit a regression line to the scatterplot. Describe the relationship illustrated. Note any suspected outliers, if any (a visual inspection will suffice for this question).

::: callout-note
The variable `gdp_per_cap` measures each country's GDP per capita (representing their individual wealth), and `life_exp` indicates the number of years individuals within that country born that year are expected to live (representing their health).

## Question 5

*Points: 10*

Estimate a bivariate regression with `life_exp` as the dependent variable and `gdp_per_cap` as the independent variable and report the results in a professionally formatted table. In as much detail as possible, describe (and interpret) the regression results.
