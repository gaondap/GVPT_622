## Conceptual Questions

Please include all work (and computations) necessary to answer the questions.

**Total points: 20 (2 points each)**

### Question 1

Suppose you estimate a bivariate regression model with a total sample size of 50 and obtain a standard error for $\beta_1$ of 2.50. What is the smallest regression coefficient ($\beta_1$) that you could have and still be able to reject the null hypothesis (of no relationship between $X_1$ and $Y$) at the 0.05 level with a one-tailed test?

**Answer**:

```{r}
#given information
q01_se <- 2.50
q01_n <- 50

#determine degrees of freedom
q01_df <- q01_n - 2 

#calculate critical value
q01_tcrit <- qt(0.95, df = q01_df, lower.tail = T)
q01_tcrit

#solve for beta 1
q01_beta01 <- q01_tcrit * q01_se
q01_beta01

```

The smallest regression coefficient ($\beta_1$) that you could have and still be able to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 level with a one-tailed test is `r q01_beta01`.

### Question 2

I regress $Y$ on $X_1$ (i.e., $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1$) and find that $\beta_1 = 4.20$, $SE_{\beta_1} = 1.90$, $t = 2.21$, $p = 0.01$, and a 95% confidence interval is \[0.48, 7.92\]. What is my best estimate of the effect of a two-unit change in $X_1$ on the mean of $Y$ in the population?

**Answer**:

```{r}
#given information
q02_beta01 <- 4.2

#calculate two-unit change
q2_change <- 2 * q02_beta01
q2_change
```

The best estimate of the effect of a two-unit change in $X_1$ on the mean of $Y$ in the population is `r q2_change`.

### Question 3

I conduct an OLS regression with a sample size of 90 and 5 independent variables. To determine a p-value for each coefficient, I would examine a t-distribution with how many degrees of freedom?

**Answer**: $$
df = n - k
$$ Following this equation, we can determine that df = 85.

### Question 4

Suppose I regress $Y$ on $X$ and compute the mean response for $Y$ at some specified value of $X$. When determining the confidence interval around this mean response, which of the following will **NOT** have any effect on the width (or size) of that confidence interval?

A.  Total sample size,

B.  Mean-squared error,

C.  The specified value of $X$,

D.  None of the above: all of these (above) will affect the confidence interval,

E.  There is not enough information to answer this question.

**Answer**: D

### Question 5

I regress $Y$ on $X$ and find that $\beta_1$ has a two-tailed p-value of 0.04. Which of the following statements is most accurate?

A.  The lower and upper bound of a 95% confidence interval around $\beta_1$ will have the same sign,

B.  The absolute value for the t-statistic for $\beta_1$ will be greater than 1.96,

C.  A 90% confidence interval around $\beta_1$ will not contain zero,

D.  All of the above,

E.  None of the above and/or there is not enough information.

**Answer**: D

### Question 6

I regress $Y$ on three independent variables -- $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$ -- and I find the following 95% confidence intervals -- $\beta_1$: \[0.12, 1.45\], $\beta_2$: \[-0.01, 0.15\], and $\beta_3$: \[-0.64, -0.01\]. Which of the following statements is most accurate?

A.  $\beta_2$ and $\beta_3$ will have negative coefficients, and $\beta_1$ is statistically significant at the 0.05 level (two-tailed),

B.  $\beta_1$ will have a positive coefficient, and $\beta_1$ is the only statistically significant coefficient (of the three coefficients) at the 0.05 level (two-tailed),

C.  $\beta_1$ will have a positive coefficient, $\beta_2$ and $\beta_3$ will have negative coefficients, and only $\beta_1$ and $\beta_3$ are statistically significant at the 0.05 level (two-tailed),

D.  All of the above,

E.  None of the above and/or there is not enough information.

**Answer**: E

### Question 7

Suppose I estimate a regression with two independent variables and obtain a $R^2$ of 0.40 where the Residual Sum of Squares is equal to 5,150. What does the Total Sum of Squares equal in this regression model?

**Answer**: $$
R^2 = 1 - \left(\frac{RSS}{TSS}\right)
$$ We can solve for the Total sum of squares by reconfiguring this formula.

$$
TSS = \left(\frac{RSS}{1 - R^2}\right)
$$

```{r}
q07_rsquared <- 0.40
q07_RSS <- 5150
q07_TSS <- (q07_RSS / (1 - q07_rsquared))
```

TSS = `r q07_TSS`.

### Question 8

I regress $Y$ on $X_1$ and $X_2$ (i.e., $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2$). I find that $\beta_1 = -0.87$ with a two-tailed p value of 0.001 and $\beta_2 = 3.52$ with a two-tailed p-value of 0.04. Which of the following statements is most accurate?

A.  $X_2$ has a larger substantive effect on $Y$ than $X_1$, but the effect of $X_1$ is more statistically significant,

B.  $X_1$ has a larger substantive effect on $Y$ than $X_2$ and $X_1$ is more statistically significant than $X_2$,

C.  $X_1$ has a larger substantive effect on $Y$ than $X_2$, but the effect of $X_2$ is more statistically significant,

D.  None of the above and/or there is not enough information.

**Answer**: A

### Question 9

I regress $Y$ on $X_1$ (i.e., $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1$) and obtain a $R^2$ of 0.45. Then, I regress $Y$ on both $X_1$ and $X_2$ (i.e., $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2$) and obtain a $R^2$ of 0.53. Which of the following statements must be true?

A.  The correlation between $X_1$ and $Y$ is stronger than the correlation between $X_2$ and $Y$,

B.  The coefficient on $\beta_1$ is statistically significant in both models,

C.  The model with $X_1$ and $X_2$ explains more of the variation in $Y$ than a model with just $X_1$,

D.  All of the above: all of these statements are true.

**Answer**: C

### Question 10

Based on the following regression equation, might the negative coefficient on the South variable be the result of southern states having a lower proportion of high school graduates than non-southern states? In no more than one sentence, explain your answer.

$$
Turnout = 34 + 0.5(Percent\ High\ School\ Graduates) â€“ 5.9(South)
$$

**Answer**: Yes. South is most likely a dummy variable where south is coded as 1, meaning a greater value is being subtracted from the total turnout rate.

## Applied Questions

All datasets referenced below are posted on the ELMs course site.

### Question 1

*Points: 15*

Use the `world` dataset to answer the following questions. The relevant variables and their coding information are as follows: `literacy` indicates a country's literacy rate; `dem_score14` represents a country's level of democratization (higher values indicate greater democratization); `spendeduc` reflects the amount of public expenditures on education as a percentage of GDP; `gdp_10_thou` represents GDP per capita (one unit is \$10,000 USD); `educ_quality` indicates the average quality rating of a country's educational system; and `ungr9095` represents the percent average annual population growth.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(scales)
library(modelsummary)
library(broom)
library(here)

#import data
world_df <- read.csv(
  here("world.csv")) |> 
  select(literacy, dem_score14, spendeduc, gdp_10_thou, educ_quality, ungr9095) 

#preview information
tibble(world_df)
```

#### Part A

*Points: 4*

Evaluate the bivariate relationship (using R) between a country's support for public education and its literacy rate. Report the results in a professionally formatted table. Do countries that spend more money on education appear to have a higher literacy rate?

**Answer**:

```{r}
#create bivariate model
model_01a <- lm(literacy ~ spendeduc, data = world_df)

#review data
summary(model_01a)

#professionally format
modelsummary(model_01a,
             coef_rename = c("literacy" = "Literacy Rate",
                             "spendeduc" = "Public Expenditures on Education (% of GDP)"
             ),
                             statistic = c("t = {statistic}", "SE = {std.error}", "conf.int"))

```

On average, holding all else constant, every one-point increase in education spending as a percentage of GDP is associated with a 1.7-point increase in literacy rate. However, this is only significant at the .10 level as its p-value (p = 0.051) is just outside of the .05 range.

#### Part B

*Points: 5*

Estimate a second regression model (using R) that includes both a country's public expenditures on education and its level of democratization as independent variables. When controlling for democratization, does education expenditures exhibit a significant impact on literacy? Report the results in a professionally formatted table. Be sure to discuss the extent to which the results change, and if so, why they changed.

**Answer**:

```{r}
#create model
model_01b <- lm(literacy ~ spendeduc + dem_score14, data = world_df)

#review data
summary(model_01b)

#professionally format
modelsummary(model_01b,
             coef_rename = c("literacy" = "Literacy Rate",
                             "spendeduc" = "Public Expenditures on Education (% of GDP)",
                             "dem_score14" = "Level of Democratization"
             ),
                             statistic = c("t = {statistic}", "SE = {std.error}", "conf.int"))
```
When controlling for democratization, education expenditures no longer exhibits a significant impact on literacy. A lower coefficient and higher p-value indicate that there is no relationship between education expenditures and literacy. Democratization, however, has a strong and significant relationship with literacy. On average and holding all else equal, a one-point increase in democracy score is associated with a 4.65 percentage point increase in literacy rate. This means that democratization is far stronger in explaining an increase in literacy rate in comparison to education expenditures.

#### Part C

*Points: 6*

Now estimate a third model (using R) that includes all of the variables listed above. Report the regression results in a professionally formatted table and interpret each coefficient. When interpreting the impact of democratization using this regression model, present/utilize a visual representation (using R) of the expected change in literacy as a function of democratization.

```{r}
#create model
model_01c <- lm(literacy ~ spendeduc + dem_score14 + gdp_10_thou + educ_quality + ungr9095, data = world_df)

#review data
summary(model_01c)

#professionally format
modelsummary(model_01c,
             coef_rename = c("literacy" = "Literacy Rate",
                             "spendeduc" = "Public Expenditures on Education (% of GDP)",
                             "dem_score14" = "Level of Democratization",
                             "gdp_10_tho" = "GDP Per Capita (in tens of thousands)",
                             "educ_quality" = "Quality of Education",
                             "ungr9095" = "Annual Population Growth (in % of total population)"
             ),
                             statistic = c("t = {statistic}", "SE = {std.error}", "conf.int"))
```


### Question 2

*Points: 15*

Using the `states` dataset, use R to regress the variable `obama08` (the percentage of a state's vote that President Obama received in the 2008 U.S. presidential election) on the following independent variables: `cig_tax` represents the amount of a state's cigarette tax (in dollars); `college` is the percentage of a state's population that graduated college (0 to 100); `union07` is the percentage of a state's workers that are union members (0 to 100); and `south` is a dichotomous variable coded as `1` if the state is located in the South (`0` otherwise). Report the results in a professionally formatted table. Answer the following questions.

#### Part A

*Points: 6*

Interpret the substantive results from this regression model. Be sure to discuss the direction, magnitude, and statistical significance of each slope coefficient. Does the `union07` variable exhibit a substantively significant impact on voting behavior in the 2008 election?

#### Part B

*Points: 2*

Interpret the intercept coefficient. What does this represent and is it meaningful to interpret this coefficient on its own? Why or why not?

#### Part C

*Points: 2*

What is the expected mean percentage of Obama's vote total in a Southern state with a cigarette tax of \$2.00, a state population where 30% of people are college graduates, and where 15% of workers in a state are union members?

#### Part D

*Points: 3*

What is a 90% confidence interval around the coefficient for the `south` variable.

#### Part E

*Points: 3*

What is the null hypothesis that the F-test in this regression output is testing?
