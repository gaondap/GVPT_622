## Question 1

*Total points: 10*

I hypothesize that the older someone is, the more they like watching golf. I conduct a survey based on an SRS of adults in America. The independent variable is a four-category measure of age: 21-35, 36-50, 51-65, 66-plus. The dependent variable is a three-category measure of how much they enjoy watching golf: not at all, somewhat, very much.

### Part A

*Points: 4*

Make a cross-tab, by hand, of the relationship between these two variables based on the following (completely made up) data. Make sure that you present both raw counts and the appropriate percentages to examine the relationship.

```{r}
age_golf_df <- tibble::tibble(
  age = c("21-35", "51-65", "66-plus", "21-35", "36-50", "21-35", "36-50",
          "66-plus", "36-50", "51-65", "51-65", "21-35", "36-50", "21-35",
          "66-plus", "51-65", "36-50", "66-plus", "51-65", "21-35", "66-plus",
          "21-35", "36-50", "66-plus", "21-35", "36-50", "21-35", "66-plus",
          "51-65", "51-65", "66-plus", "21-35", "66-plus", "21-35", "51-65",
          "66-plus", "21-35", "36-50", "36-50", "66-plus"),
  preference = c("Somewhat", "Not at all", "Very much", "Not at all", "Somewhat",
                 "Not at all", "Not at all", "Somewhat", "Very much", "Very much",
                 "Somewhat", "Not at all", "Somewhat", "Very much", "Not at all",
                 "Not at all", "Somewhat", "Somewhat", "Very much", "Somewhat",
                 "Very much", "Somewhat", "Very much", "Somewhat", "Not at all",
                 "Very much", "Somewhat", "Somewhat", "Somewhat", "Very much",
                 "Not at all", "Not at all", "Very much", "Somewhat", "Very much",
                 "Very much", "Somewhat", "Somewhat", "Somewhat", "Not at all")
)

### Part B

*Points: 2*

Do the data support my hypothesis? Be sure to explain the nature of the relationship (or lack thereof, if relevant).

### Part C

*Points: 2*

Compute (by hand) the chi-square statistic to test the null hypothesis of no relationship between these two variables. Be sure to show your work.

### Part D

*Points: 2*

Using the chi-square statistic that you computed in question 1(c), can you reject the null hypothesis of no relationship between these two variables with 95% confidence? Why, or why not?

## Question 2

*Points: 10*

I hypothesize that people with higher levels of education tend to be more likely to pay higher levels of attention to politics. Use the `nes` dataset from the `poliscidols` package to test my hypothesis. Create a cross-tab examining the relationship between individuals' levels of education (`education`) and the time they spend paying attention to politics (`attention_to_politics`).

Do the data support my hypothesis? Be sure to explain the nature of the relationship (or lack thereof, if relevant). Report a chi-square statistic. What does the chi-square statistic tell you about whether you can reject the null hypothesis of no relationship between these two variables with 95% confidence? Why, or why not?
